I am a Ph.D. Student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Texas at Austin co-advised by Drs. [Aryan Mokhtari](https://sites.utexas.edu/mokhtari/) and [Sanjay Shakkottai](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/home). My current research focuses on efficient model fine-tuning and unlearning.

I received my B.S.E in Electrical Engineering from the University of Michigan in 2023.
